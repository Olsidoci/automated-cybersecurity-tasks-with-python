# Login Log Parser Project

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world scenario where a security analyst must:
- Import and parse a login log file (`login.txt`)
- Correct a missing log entry
- Split and analyze log data
- Create and populate an `allow_list.txt` with trusted IPs

All code is written in Python and executed in a Google Colab notebook.
